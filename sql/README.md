Put .sql files here.

Primarily these will be bulk upload files using COPY... FROM... \.

Possibly some queries will be used for assigning sequence IDs for populating parent tables, and joins for populating xref tables.

If a sequence of .sql files should be loaded in a specific sequence, put ii_ numbers at start of filename.

Likely there will be either bash or R scripts to handle such loading.
