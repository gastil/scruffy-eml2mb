mNotes as Gastil and others learn about xmltable stuff2

postgres table names cannot have a dash aka minus sign in them.
Same for dot aka period.

If I want to name a table for the eml doc's contents it will hold, I cannot name it knb-lter-foo.6.7
These are temporary tables (in the sense we will not keep them; not the technical meaning of 
temporary table in sql).

If I want to load one whole eml doc at a time, should I give it its own table?
Or its own row(s) of a table?

one table : one eml doc
at least for the example Im working from.

So, knb-lter-foo.6.7 could have its own table named knb_lter_foo_6_7.

First be sure none of your eml docs contain the string $$.
That is used as a kind of heredoc delimeter.
