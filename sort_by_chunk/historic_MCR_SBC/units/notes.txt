There are 59 eml docs in ../list_of_docs.txt
There are 86 output lines in output of the xsl (no hdr)

You mean I only have 86 uses of units??! Thats not very many.

cut -f1 -d'|' output | sort | uniq | wc -l
20
So only 20 of my 59 eml does have ANY units?!

grep "<additionalMetadata" knb-lter-mcr.* | wc -l
29
So Im guessing 29 of my eml docs have units, not 20 of them. Why didnt the xsl
find all of these?

Ah hah. Sometimes I didnt put the stmml namespace on unitList. Urph.

Now 113 rows in output.
29 eml datasets have units.
That matches.

The above are only the CUSTOM units. The standard units were not collected by
that xsl. The standard units are (I think) already in the Metabase
UnitDictionary. Those will need to be collected for dataset:unit xref but are
not needed for the population of the unit parent table.

cut -f2 -d'|' output | sort | uniq > uniq_unit_ids
52 uniq unit ids
A few of these differ only in plural
 
----------------
	Unit Dictionary
-----------------

already loaded in Mb in the EMLUnitDictionary table are
	 25 custom units
	193 standard units

Now
	(1) outer join between my custom units in use in my EML and MbUD
	(2) where appropriate, append my custom units to MbUD
	--- or ---
	(3) clean up my units so they match ones in the MbUD

Any unit in (3) that changes its id would also have to be changed in the
attributes loaded into scratch before that can be uploaded to DSV2.

Presumably all std units will match; could outer join to verify.

Added several new EMLUnitTypes to Mb parent table, with Margaret's blessing.

---------------

After MUCH cleanup, when I was satisfied all my units which had id's already
in the dictionary could use the dictionary's entries (after leaning up those
in the dictionary), I then queried out just the set whose id did not yet
appear in the dictionary. These I then psql-bulk-uploaded into the dictionary.

Once done cleaning up, I have 56 units from additionalMetadata, each used once
to 7 times.

select s.id , s.name, s."unitType", s.abbreviation,
s."multiplierToSI",s."parentSI",s."constantToSI", s.description, true as
"custom"
from metabase2."EMLUnitDictionary" m
full outer join
(
select id, name, "unitType", abbreviation,
"multiplierToSI","parentSI","constantToSI", description
from scratch.dataset_units_denorm
group by id, name, "unitType", abbreviation,
"multiplierToSI","parentSI","constantToSI", description
) as s
on s.id=m.id
where m.id is null
order by s.id

-------
looking at the units in DataSetVariables2, I have 70 unique unit ids,
all of which are now in the EMLUnitDictionary either as standard or custom.
