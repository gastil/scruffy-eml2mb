1|2012-04-15|<para>These data describe the species richness and abundance as part of MCR LTER's reef fish monitoring program to track long-term patterns in species abundance and diversity. This study began in 2000 in the lagoons off of the north shore of the island of Moorea, French Polynesia and the dataset is updated annually. The abundance and life history stage (adults, juveniles or recruits) of all taxa of fishes associated with selected colonies (5-16 colonies per site) of the mound forming coral Porites rus are recorded at seven reef sites located along the north shore of Moorea. These sites are characterized by differences in water depth, distance to the fore reef and the number and types of neighboring corals. Counts are performed by a pair of divers using SCUBA and include semi-cryptic species.</para>
10|2013-06-20|<para>This data package contains water chemistry measurements taken 2 to 4 times per year at 6 stations on the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia: Forereef, Lagoon, Fringing Reef, Cooks Bay, Cooks Bay Stream Mouth, and Offshore (5 km due north). Measurements include standard CTD parameters, nutrients, chlorophyll, phaeopigments, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, water column primary production, and abundance of bacteria. Sampling began in August, 2005. All water samples were collected with Niskin Bottles. CTD data were collected with a SBE19-Plus Seacat Profiler outfitted with WetLabs FLNTURT-221 Flurometer/turbidity sensors. CTD and bottle samples were taken on separate casts at each station. Two additional stations on the Moorea east shore were sampled in August 2005 only: LTER 3 Forereef Water Column, LTER 3 Backreef Water Column.</para>
1034|2013-05-01|<section><para>This data package contains water chemistry measurements taken approximately bi-monthly at 3 stations on the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia: Forereef, Lagoon, Fringing Reef. Nutrients are measured from water samples collected with Niskin bottles or Falcon tubes. For completeness, nutrient measurements are reported even when concentrations are below the detection limit of the method, which commonly occurs at this site. Sampling began in August, 2005 and is ongoing.</para></section>
1035|2012-10-23|<para>A continuous time series of water temperature is measured with bottom-mounted thermistors at six sites around the shores of Moorea, on the fringing reef, backreef, and forereef. The forereef temperature is recorded at 10, 20, 30 and 40 m, the backreef at 1 m and the fringing reef at 1 and 5 m. SBE 39s are deployed to the forereef and backreef. Onset HOBOs are deployed on the fringing reef. Temperature data are processed and resampled to a 20 minute time step.</para>

1038|2012-03-09|<para>This dataset contains the percentage cover of all stony corals (Scleractinia, pooled among genera) and other major groups analyzed from 0.5 x 0.5 m photographic quadrats at the Backreef habitat at the Moorea Coral Reef LTER, French Polynesia. This survey time series began in 2005 and is repeated each year in April. Functional groups counted are: Scleractinian corals, Macroalgae, Crustose Coralline Algae / Bare Space, Soft Corals, Hydrocorals (<emphasis>Millepora</emphasis>), Algal Turf and Sand. The coral community was sampled photographically in all represented habitats surrounding the island: Fringing Reef, Lagoon, and Outer Reef. This dataset contains only Lagoon (Backreef) data (see knb-lter-mcr.4 for the other habitats) and is structured in a repeated-measures protocol to allow a statistical contrast of sites, shores and times. Community structure was determined through a coarse analysis of the benthic community, initially completed in situ (2005), but using photoquadrats from 2006. There are quadrats analyzed at each of five areas within each site, and the areas are revisited (but not the quadrats) each year to support the repeated measures design. There are two tables available, providing different views of the same data: a long table having all values in one column and a wide table having a separate column for each observed object. Detailed methods are available in the protocols section.</para>
1039|2012-05-21|<para>These data describe the abundance of Acanthaster planci, Crown of Thorns Sea stars, surveyed as part of MCR LTER's annual reef fish monitoring program. This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. The abundances of A. planci observed on a five by fifty meter transect are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea time) during late July or early August each year. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of three habitats (forereef, backreef and fringing reef) at six locations, two on each of Moorea's three sides, on the forereef, six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small, stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 12m, those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m. This monitoring program is consistent with the protocols adopted by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and the Australian Institute of Marine Science for use with the Great Barrier Reef Long-term Monitoring Program.</para><para>These data from years 2005-2010 were published in: Adam, T.C., R.J.

Sampling began in 2005 for this time series. Data are interpolated onto a 20 minute grid. The two moored CTD packages are located approximately 5 and 14 meters above the bottom, and there are up to 5 additional temperature thermistors spaced vertically along the mooring line.</para><para>This dataset is derived as a subset from three separate much larger more complex datasets: knb-lter-mcr.30, knb-lter-mcr.31, and knb-lter-mcr.32.</para>
12|2012-03-28|<para>This data package contains measurements of the sedimentation rate of particulate matter to the seafloor on the forereef, backreef and fringing reef of the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia, during 2 to 4 seasons per year from August 2005 to January 2011. Measurements include estimates of the accumulation rate of particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and dry mass. Samples were collected with 2 different types of sediment traps. From August, 2005 to January 2008 samples were collected using plastic door matting placed in plastic trays 1 cm deep and 195.5 cm2 in area. From January, 2008 to January, 2011 samples were collected in plastic tubes 5.2 cm inside diameter and 17.5 cm high (21.26 cm2). During each sampling period 3 replicate traps were placed at random on the seafloor and retrieved approximately 24 hours later. See caveats to data interpretation in methods discussion.</para>
13|2012-03-15|<para>This data package contains zooplankton abundance and taxonomic composition measured at 5 stations on the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia: Forereef, Backreef, Fringing Reef, Cooks Bay, and Oceanic (5 km due north) from 2005 to 2010. Day time measurements over the reef were taken with a 30 cm, 200 μm mesh plankton net equipped with a slow speed General Oceanics Model 2030 flow meter. Nets were swum horizontally by a diver 1 m above the bottom at Forereef, Backreef and Fringing Reef sites. Daytime sampling at the Oceanic and Cooks Bay sites consisted of 0-50 m, 0-100 or 0-30 m vertical tows with a 30 cm, 200 μm mesh plankton net equipped with a standard General Oceanics Model 2030 flow meter. Nighttime sampling and some daytime sampling was done at the Forereef, Backreef and Fringing Reef sites using automated plankton pumps equipped with flow meters and 200 μm internal nets (described in Alldredge and King, 2009). These pumps sampled 75 cm above the bottom for 1 to 1.5 hours beginning at 11 pm local time. Nocturnal zooplankton abundance was sensitive to lunar phase. On some sampling dates pump samples were taken at the same depth in duplicate, or at several different depths simultaneously. The zooplankton time series was terminated when it became clear that the variability in zooplankton abundance over just 50 cm difference in depth over the reef was greater than the variability seasonally or even day to night (Alldredge and King, 2009).</para><para>Alldredge AL and J M King 2009.

15|2011-02-03|<para>Coral are symbiotic with photosynthetic dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium. There are eight divergent clades (A-H) within the genus which each contain many genetic varieties. Different types of Symbiodinium have been shown to affect the growth rate and thermal tolerance of the coral. The diversity and population structure of Symbiodinium on a reef and how it changes over time is therefore critical to the stability and resilience of coral reefs. Our research conducted through the MCR LTER project aims at defining the population structure of Symbiodinium present in the corals of Moorea and documenting changes over time.</para>
16|2012|<para>These data describe the genetics of recruiting Dascyllus trimaculatus. We first placed two rows of 8 anemones in a region (the west side of the bay of Opunohu) previously devoid of anemones. Anemones are 10 meters apart, the two rows are 100 meters apart. The row close to the reef crest is called crest , or OUT, row, the row away from the crest and close to the boat channel is called channel, or IN, row. The project started with the placement of the anemones in the fall of 2000. Since then, we regularly clear the anemones of Dascyllus and then collect newly settled fishes every morning. These fishes are later typed by sequencing the mitochondrial control region. Fishes are labeled as follows: DTR IN 01010205. This is a Dascyllus Trimaculatus collected on the channel row, first anemone, on January 2nd 2005. Anemones are numbered 1 to 8, from west to east.</para><para>These data are published in<ulink>Bernardi, G., R. Beldade, S.J. Holbrook and R.J. Schmitt. 2012.

17|2012-04-15|<para>These data describe the genetics of recruiting Amphiprion chrysopterus. Our goal is to score every single clownfish from the island of Moorea (we believe that the total population in Moorea is of approximately 300-500 individuals). Individuals are characterized using microsatellites, thus the data are presented as a matrix of alleles corresponding to a set of microsatellite loci. Ultimately, we want to determine the level of self-recruitment in Moorea by estimating the number of offspring which recruit on Moorea and that are derived from Moorea parents.</para><para>These data are published in<ulink>DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2011.2433</ulink>Beldade, R., S.J.

18|2010-06-04|<para>The data presented here are rates of community primary production and respiration for two sites on the north shore of Moorea. Estimates are made from upstream-downstream sampling of dissolved oxygen, measurement of water column velocity, and in situ light (PAR) levels. Estimates are made yearly across approximately 160 m of the backreef community.</para>
19|2012-08-01|<para>Estimates of primary production and respiration of three representative components of the Moorea coral reef ecosystem are made yearly in a laboratory flume. The components are: algal turf communities, the macroalga Sargassum pacificum, and the common branching coral Pocillopora verrucosa. Metabolism estimates are made using changes in dissolved oxygen over time in a flume in unidirectional flow at saturating irradiances and dark. Rates are normalized to projected (planar) surface area (all components) and biomass (algal turfs, Sargassum).</para>
2|2012-03-28|<para>These data describe the abundance of adult-stage three-spot dascyllus (Dascyllus trimaculatus), a planktivorous damselfish, and their juvenile microhabitat, the sea anemone Heteractis magnifica. Surveys were begun in 1992 and have been conducted two to four times annually by the same observer in the lagoons of the north shore of the island of Moorea in French Polynesia.</para>
20|2012-03-19|<para>Samples of two common macroalgal species (Sargassum mangarevense, Turbinaria ornata) are collected yearly from fringing, backreef, and reef crest sites at each of the sites (LTER 1 through LTER 6) around Moorea. CHN analyses of dried, ground samples of each individual are made using standard methods.</para><para>CHN data are used to track sustained variation in nutrient availability. Water column nutrients in coral reef systems usually are low to undetectable and their inputs tend to be episodic and ephemeral. Using CHN contents of macroalgae allows the integration of nitrogen availability over a longer time period, in this case, over approximately 3 months.</para>
2001|2010|<para>Branching corals, like many in the genus Acropora, provide structurally complex habitats for reef fishes and other organisms. Fluctuations in the abundance, distribution and characteristics of staghorn Acroporid corals may contribute to changes in the abundance and species composition of reef fishes due to changes in the availability of shelter habitat and food. Farming damselfishes of the genus Stegastes occur in high abundances in staghorn thickets and actively defend food and nest space against organisms that threaten these resources. Here I examine the value of staghorn thickets as habitat for fishes, and how the presence of territorial farming damselfishes may influence the assemblage of fishes that associate with staghorn corals. Surveys of 185 Acropora pulchra thickets located in the lagoons surrounding the island of Moorea, French Polynesia revealed 85 species of fish from 25 families. Total fish abundance and species richness values ranged from no fish on a thicket to a high of 275 individuals and 26 species. Thicket area was the most important characteristic in explaining variation in attributes of the fish assemblage among staghorn thickets, with other characteristics explaining little of the species composition or trophic structure. Behavioral observations revealed that farming damselfishes were most aggressive toward corallivores, herbivores, and egg predators, while they ignored most carnivores and omnivores. Despite this pattern, I observed positive covariance between Stegastes and the group of fishes that elicited the strongest aggressive response when the effect of thicket area was removed, suggesting these fishes remain drawn to the resources produced or enhanced by Stegastes on A. pulchra thickets.</para>
2002|2012-02-24|<para>For many marine invertebrates, the maximum size of an individual is influenced heavily by environmental factors and may be limited by energetic constraints. In this study, an energetic model developed originally for anemones was applied to the free-living scleractinian<emphasis>Fungia concinna</emphasis>(Verrill) from Moorea, French Polynesia to test the hypothesis that energetic constraints limit the size of this solitary coral. The modified model assumed that photosynthesis was the primary source of metabolic energy, and that metabolic costs were represented by aerobic respiration; these sources and sinks of energy were compared using daily energy budgets that were analyzed using double logarithmic regressions of energy against coral size.</para><para>These data were published in<ulink>Elahi, R. and P.J.

21|2012-03-16|<para>This data package contains demersal zooplankton abundance and taxonomic composition measured at 3 stations on the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia: Forereef, Backreef and Fringing Reef from 2005 to 2010. Demersal zooplankton emerging from sand or rubble substrates on the reef during the night were captured in 8 inverted funnel traps placed on the substrate in the late afternoon and retrieved the following morning. Traps were made of 200 Î¼m mesh netting with the opening to the cod end located 18 cm above the bottom. Four traps, each covering 0.0615 m2 of substrate, were combined to obtain one sample for counting. The table reports means of 2 replicates each containing 4 combined traps. Traps placed over sand were pushed into the substrate. However, traps over rubble had numerous gaps along their bases allowing some contamination from the water column. Data are expressed as number of animals emerging per square meter of bottom.</para>

4|2013-03-28|<para>This dataset contains the percentage cover of the stony corals (Scleractinia) and other major groups analyzed from 0.5 x 0.5 m photographic quadrats at several reef habitats at the Moorea Coral Reef LTER, French Polynesia. This survey has been repeated annually in April since 2005. There are two tables available, providing different views of the same data: a long table having all values in one column and a wide table having a separate column for each observed object. Functional groups counted are: Scleractinian Corals (by genus where appropriate, see methods), Macroalgae, Crustose Coralline Algae / Bare Space, Soft Corals, Hydrocorals (Millepora), Algal Turf and Sand. The coral community was sampled photographically in all represented habitats surrounding the island: Fringing Reef, Lagoon, and Outer Reef. The sampling regime consists of a repeated-measures protocol in each habitat, and is structured by habitat to allow a statistical contrast of sites, shores, times, and in the case of the outer reef, depths. Detailed methods are available in the protocols section.</para>
4001|2011-12-01|<para>These data describe the recruitment of scleractinian corals to unglazed terracotta tiles secured independently to horizontal reef surfaces. The tiles are positioned horizontally to create a cryptic habitat beneath (approximately 1 cm high) and are in place approximately 6 months at a time; they are replaced ca. January and September. The tiles are bleached and inspected for coral skeletons using a dissecting microscope. Coral recruits are resolved to three families (Poritidae, Acroporidae, Pocilloporidae, and "others") and are scored on upper, lower and side surfaces. Data are available for the back reef (2006-present) and outer reef (2007-present).</para>
4002|2011-11-28|<para>These data describe the density (colonies per quadrat of 0.5 x 0.5 m size) of juvenile corals on the fringing reefs and outer reef (10 m depth) of Moorea. Beginning in 2005, surveys are completed annually at LTER 1 and 2 in the austral autumn (April-May). Addition event-motivated sampling began in 2011 with additional sites from the other two shores of Moorea surveyed and surveys at LTER 1 and 2 repeated in August; these surveys will likely continue for 1-2 years but will not become a maintained component of the annual sampling. The focus is on juvenile corals defined as individuals less than or equal to 40 mm diameter. These data include juvenile scleractinian corals and juvenile Millepora spp. (Class: Hydrozoa; Order Hydroida, Sub Order Anthomedusae, Family Milleporidae). These transects are co-located with annual photographic surveys and, therefore, broad community descriptors are also available.</para>
4003|2011-12-15|<para>These data describe the results of outer reef surveys that are conducted on an irregular schedule to quantify coral reef community dynamics on a scale of kilometers. The first island-wide survey was completed in 2006, and the second in 2010; we anticipate conducting such surveys every 5-6 years or as needed to capture the large-scale effects of disturbance regimes. The island-wide sampling adds 3 new sites per shore (for a total of 5 sites/shore with the fixed LTER sites) in each year that the larger scale analyses are completed.</para>

Sampling began in 2006 and is ongoing. The CTD measures conductivity, temperature, pressure, from which density and salinity are calculated. Data are collected every 5 minutes, processed and reported every 20 minutes. The instrument is mounted 2 m above the bottom in 6 m of depth. These data stream near real-time as part of the Digital Moorea project. Daily, weekly, monthly and yearly means are calculated for temperature, salinity, and density.</para>
4005|2012-08-28|<para>These data contain a time-series from sequential deployments of an ALW-CMP PAR sensor recording quanta of photosynthetically active radiation underwater between wavelengths 400 nm to 700 nm every two seconds. The sensor window is wiped free of algae periodically to prevent fouling. Deployments are three to six months in length. The sensor was mounted at 17 m depth on the fore reef, and at 2 m depth on the Backreef. PAR irradiance is measured as quanta in micromoles of photons per square meter per second.</para>
5|2013-03-01|<para>Monthly averages of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST), the Sub-surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl), the colored dissolved and detrital organic materials at 443 nm (acdm[443]) and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 443 nm (bbp[443]) around Moorea are obtained or derived from satellite data (SST from AVHRR and MODIS-Aqua; Chl, acdm[443] and bbp[443] from SeaWiFS and MODIS-AQUA). The satellite data are averaged over a 1 month period for geographic areas of 16S-19S/147W-151W (SeaWiFS and MODIS-AQUA) and 15S-20S/145W-155W for AVHRR.</para>
5001|2010-06-04|<para>These data represent abundances of infaunal invertebrates in lagoonal sand flats along the north shore of Moorea. Surveys were conducted once along five transects in the Vaipahu lagoon within the LTER 1 study site. The number of individuals from distinct invertebrate taxa were counted from 1815 cubic centimeter sand cores taken at varying distances from a large patch reef. The data also include sand grain size distributions.</para>
5003|2011-05-24|<para>This dataset contains vertical water column profiles along transects heading offshore over the forereefs on the three sides of Moorea. These sides are designated north, southeast, and southwest. This process study intended to look for a hypothesized buoyant flow that would account for the counter-clockwise (CCW) circulation around the island. These transects were designed to look for cross-shore density gradients associated with the CCW flow. The SeaBird SBE19-Plus Profiler (CTD), outfitted with WetLabs FLNTURT-221 fluorometer, was cast at closely-spaced stations along transects oriented approximately normal to the three sides of the island.

These results show that massive<emphasis>Porites</emphasis>spp. has the capacity to resist the effects on calcification of 1 month exposure to 81.5 Pa pCO<subscript>2</subscript>through heterotrophy and changes in biomass. Area-normalized calcification is sustained at high pCO<subscript>2</subscript>by a greater biomass with a reduced biomass-normalized rate of calcification.

5008|2013-03-01|<para>We analyzed network level specialization for eight Indo-Pacific networks of obligate, mutualistic gobies and shrimps, and elucidated ecological and evolutionary factors driving specialization. To accomplish this we collected and analyzed data on species pairings in Moorea, French Polynesia (lat. -17.49, long. -149.84), Kenting, Taiwan (lat. 21.95, long. 120.76), and Kimbe Bay, New Britain, Papua New Guinea (PNG; lat. -5.50, long. 150.12), and combined these observations with previously published data from Seychelles Islands (Polunin and Lubbock 1977), Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Cummins 1979), Red Sea, Israel (Karplus et al. 1981), Japan (Yanagisawa 1984), and the Gulf of Thailand, Thailand (Nakasone and Manthachitra 1986). We also systematically collected and analyzed habitat data for shrimps and gobies in Moorea, Taiwan, and PNG. We found specialization was affected by variability in habitat use for both gobies and shrimps and by phylogenetic history for shrimps. Habitat use was phylogenetically conserved among shrimp, and thus effects of shrimp phylogeny on partner choice were mediated in part by habitat. By contrast, habitat use and pairing patterns in gobies were not related to phylogenetic history. This asymmetry appears to result from evolutionary constraints on partner use in shrimps and convergence among distantly-related gobies to utilize burrows provided by multiple shrimp species. Results indicate that the evolution of mutualism is affected by life history characteristics that transcend environments and that different factors constrain interactions in disparate ecosystems.</para><para>These data are associated with this publication: Thompson AR, Adam TC, Hultgren KM, Thacker CE (in press).

6|2013-05-22|<para>These data describe the species abundance and size distributions of fishes surveyed as part of MCR LTER's annual reef fish monitoring program. This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. The abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) observed on a five by fifty meter transect which extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea time) during late July or early August each year. In 2006, divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small, stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 12m, those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m. In addition to the biotic data collected, divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed, wind speed and sea state, swell height in m, amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visability in m. This monitoring program is consistent with the protocols adopted by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and the Australian Institute of Marine Science for use with the Great Barrier Reef Long-term Monitoring Program.</para>

Counts are made in one-meter-squared quadrats.</para>
7001|2012-05-21|<para>These data describe the species abundance, size distributions, and habitat associations of roving herbivorous fishes (fishes belonging to the families, Acanthuridae, Scaridae, and Siganidae) found in different habitats in the lagoon and forereef on the north shore of Moorea. Adult fishes and large juveniles were counted (and their size estimated) by a SCUBA diver or snorkeler on thirty-four 50 m by 5 m wide transects. After counting large fishes, the entire transect was swam a second time, with the diver looking exclusively for small juvenile fishes on a 1 m swath. In addition to recording the species identity and estimated size of each juvenile encountered, the diver also recorded the particular microhabitat each individual or group of individuals was associated with. Finally, to quantify the relative availability of different types of microhabitat, the diver conducted point contacts where the primary benthic substrate was identified at regular (1 m) intervals on the same transect.</para>
7002|2012-05-21|<para>These data describe bite rates of two abundant species of roving herbivorous fishes found on the forereef, Chlorurus sordidus (Scaridae), and Ctenochaetus striatus (Acanthuridae). During several days in July and August 2010, a SCUBA diver followed individual focal fish for a period of up to 5 minutes and recorded the number of bites taken as well the types of substrates bitten. Upon randomly locating a focal individual, divers estimated the total length of that individual as well as their depth at the initiation (and termination) of the observation. Data are organized in two data tables. The first data table (Focal_Herbivore_Bite_Rates) contains individuals that were observed at two depths (~ 10 m and ~ 17 m) at LTER 1 as part of a balanced sampling design (see Sampling Protocol/Design). The second data table (Additional_Bite_Rate_Data) contains individuals that were observed opportunistically at LTER 1 and Resilience 2. To minimize the effect of time of day on fish behavior, all data were collected between 10:00 and 16:00, a period of time which corresponds with peak feeding rates for many herbivorous fishes.</para><para>*** This is an offline dataset (LTER Network Type II).

7003|2012-05-21|<para>These data describe habitat associations of juvenile parrotfish (Scaridae) encountered during systematic searches at LTER 1 and LTER 2 fringing reef and back reef sites during March 2011. At each site SCUBA divers or snorkelers identified, counted, and estimated the sizes of juvenile parrotfish and recorded the microhabitat that each individual or group of individuals was associated with on two 100 m x 10 m wide transects (n = 8 transects total). Upon encountering a juvenile or group of juveniles, the surveyor recorded the microhabitat type that fishes were first seen to be closest to. They also closely observed the behavior of fishes to see if they were utilizing a particular microhabitat as shelter, and if so this was also recorded. Several groups of fishes first observed to be grazing on hard substrate or on macroalgae quickly retreated into the nearby coral Porites rus when approached. Hence for these individuals we considered the initial habitat they were associated with (e.g., hard substrate or macroalgae) to be their primary microhabitat, but also noted that they were associated with Porites rus for shelter.</para>
7004|2012-05-21|<para>Caged tiles were placed at various sites to measure short-term algal accumulation in the absence of grazing by fishes or large invertebrates.</para><para>These data document biomass of algae that accumulated on unglazed ceramic tiles (2.5 cm X 2.5 cm) placed inside cages (mesh size = 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm) at various sites around the island of Moorea for a period of 3 to 4 weeks. Three separate experiments were conducted (one during July-August 2010 and two in July-August 2011). In the first experiment (2010_Production), we measured the accumulation of algae after 24 days at two different depths on the forereef (10 and 17 m), and within the lagoon at four different distances from the reef crest (approximately 25, 100, 400, and 700 m). In the second experiment (2011_Production_Summary), we measured the accumulation of algae after 24 or 25 days at six forereef sites (LTER 1, Resilience 2, LTER 3, LTER 4, LTER 5, LTER 6). In this experiment, tiles were placed adjacent to the fish transects (see knb-lter-mcr.6) at a depth of 12 m. In the final experiment (Production_Time_Series), we measured the accumulation of algae on tiles at three day intervals over a period of 31 days.

Five treatments were initially established to create a gradient in grazing pressure with a sixth treatment established shortly thereafter. Each treatment was replicated ten times using a randomized block design. Each cage initially contained four tiles, and one tile from each cage has been photographed and destructively sampled for biomass at regular intervals. In addition to the original tiles deployed in July 2010, tiles were subsequently deployed in March 2011, August 2011, and March 2012 to test whether community development varies among seasons.</para><para>*** All but one table in this dataset are restricted (LTER Network Type II).

7008|2012-05-30|<para>These data describe the dynamics of corals, invertebrates, and fishes on 5 m X 5 m plots on the forereef following an outbreak of corallivorous crown-of-thorns seastars (Acanthaster planci) that caused mass coral mortality (see Adam et al. 2011). Twenty plots were first established at Resilience 2 during July 2009. Half of these plots were randomly assigned to a structure removal treatment and all dead coral structure was removed by divers, while the other half remained unmanipulated. Following the establishment of these plots, in February 2010 this site was impacted strongly by tropical cyclone Oli with the result that most of the structure was removed from all plots. Consequently, during July 2010, a structure/no structure experiment was initiated on ten plots (5 removals and 5 controls) at a site not impacted by Cyclone Oli (Resilience 3). Finally, during July 2011, five unmanipulated plots were established at each of four additional sites (Resilience 1, 4, 5, 6) so that community trajectories could be compared among sites. Counts of fishes, invertebrates, and corals are made regularily (at least annually). Coral and invertebrate counts are each separated into two data tables to reflect slightly different methodology. Initial coral counts included counts (and size estimates) of all stony corals, while later counts focused on corals from three genera, Pocillopora, Acropora, and Porites. Initial counts of invertebrates did not include information on size; all invertebrates were measured in later counts. In addition to in situ counts, all plots are photographed annually in 0.5 m by 0.5 m segments (e.g., 100 photos per plot).</para><para>*** This is an offline dataset (LTER Network Type II).

Assays were conducted during June and July 2011 to test the palatability of these algae to fishes on the forereef. Whole plants were collected from the reef crest and back reef, spun dry in a salad spinner, weighed, and then out planted on the forereef at a depth of approximately 10 m. Samples were subsequently collected, dried, and weighed to determine the amount of algae eaten. Algae were also deployed nearby in cages and in flow-through seawater ponds as controls.

Data were derived from a randomly chosen subset of photo quadrats associated with knb-lter-mcr.4. For each quadrat, individual coral colonies were identified to genus, scored as living or dead, and the total area of their footprint calculated.
