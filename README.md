# scruffy-eml2mb
Preliminary staging area for eml2mb. 

## the project
eml2mb is the process of bulk uploading content from a collection of existing eml docs to initially populate metabase. Tools hopefully will also include single eml doc uploading as initial population or as updates. If the tool can be refined enough to be easy to use by a non-expert, frosting on the cake. More likely is a tool that one of the developers can hands-on assist a new user to implement. Since it may only ever be used once by each site, and only a few sites, that may be most practical.

## the plan
We want the real LTER/eml2mb repo to be organized and curated before it goes under the LTER github organization. This temporary repo here is where to gather files, decide on subdir structure, and compose some docs, detail the plan.

## the players
Add your name and role here.
- Gastil: repo disorganiser, xslt and bash collector, beta tester, complainer.
