# How this repo might be organized

- subdirs by code type
- subdirs by parts of eml (aka "chunks")
- subdirs by metabase tables to populate

Should we put all the code together pertaining to mining and loading one type of metadata? 
Or should we separate the code by language?
It is easier to see how the pieces fit when grouped by metadata type (ie keywords, or people)
especially when there are miscellaneous files like hdr, example output, often named the same in each
subdir (by metadata type) but different files. So maybe I'm organizing this repo all inside-out.
