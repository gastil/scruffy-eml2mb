How to initially populate a new installation of Metabase using a collection of pre-existing EML docs.

- Install Metabase from LTER/LTER-core-metabase
- Gather all your EML docs into a directory and name them by packageId
- Get a zip of this LTER/eml2mb (or whatever it gets named)
- Choose bash or R for the controller script
- Run the controller script
- Get MetaEgress from its repo
- Run MetaEgress in batch for all your EML docs
- Compare those to the originals
- Send chocolate, preferably 65% cacao with almonds, to each developer
